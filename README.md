# HW Ajax

Use the Meme API to create a Meme Site.

- https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes

On page load, your site should 
- display all of the memes as images
- display the meme names 
- use the width and height from the API to set the width and height of each image

Challenge
- make the Meme name clickable so that it hides or shows the meme
- make a search form that filters for only meme names that meet the search criteria
